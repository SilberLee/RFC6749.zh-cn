1.3.1. 授权码 Authorization Code
=======================
授权码通过使用授权服务器做为客户端与资源所有者的中介而获得。客户端不是直接从资源所有者请求授权，而是引导资源所有者至授权服务器（由在[RFC2616][RFC2616]中定义的用户代理），授权服务器之后引导资源所有者带着授权码回到客户端。  
The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server as an intermediary between the client and resource owner.  Instead of requesting authorization directly from the resource owner, the client directs the resource owner to an authorization server (via its user-agent as defined in [RFC2616]), which in turn directs the resource owner back to the client with the authorization code.

在引导资源所有者携带授权码返回客户端前，授权服务器会鉴定资源所有者身份并获得其授权。由于资源所有者只与授权服务器进行身份验证，所以资源所有者的凭据不需要与客户端分享。  
Before directing the resource owner back to the client with the authorization code, the authorization server authenticates the resource owner and obtains authorization.  Because the resource owner only authenticates with the authorization server, the resource owner's credentials are never shared with the client.

授权码提供了一些重要的安全益处，例如验证客户端身份的能力，以及向客户端直接的访问令牌的传输而非通过资源所有者的用户代理来传送它而潜在暴露给他人（包括资源所有者）。  
The authorization code provides a few important security benefits, such as the ability to authenticate the client, as well as the transmission of the access token directly to the client without passing it through the resource owner's user-agent and potentially exposing it to others, including the resource owner.

1.3.4. 客户端凭据 Client Credentials
====================
当授权范围限于客户端控制下的受保护资源或事先与授权服务器商定的受保护资源时客户端凭据可以被用作为一种授权许可。典型的当客户端代表自己表演（客户端也是资源所有者）或者基于与授权服务器事先商定的授权请求对受保护资源的访问权限时，客户端凭据被用作为授权许可。  
The client credentials (or other forms of client authentication) can be used as an authorization grant when the authorization scope is limited to the protected resources under the control of the client, or to protected resources previously arranged with the authorization server.  Client credentials are used as an authorization grant typically when the client is acting on its own behalf (the client is also the resource owner) or is requesting access to protected resources based on an authorization previously arranged with the authorization server.
